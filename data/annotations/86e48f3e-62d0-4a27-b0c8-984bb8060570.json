To get into things without blabbing about local events, as I'll probably find ample opportunity to do so during various points during the evening, I'd like to just say, well, you know, thanks for coming. Clifton's really going to dig it, I know you're going to dig him and, um, I got a couple special surprises, the first of who I'll introduce right now. It's Norman Nawrocki. Can you welcome Norman, he's going to kick things off for us. [Audience applause]. | Video Description: Camera zooms in as Lee Gotham addresses audience while adjusting microphone stand.
