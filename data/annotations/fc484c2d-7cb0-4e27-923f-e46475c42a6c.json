The fast food delivery of a poetry slam. Spoken words, there's a lot of room created like a community, I think in a spoken word event where you see a lot of interactive action. You see a lot of work coming out of the presentation of work, spoken words. So. Blah, blah blah, let's watch some spoken word.
