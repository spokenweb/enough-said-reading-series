We're launching a cassette among other things, Broken Spoken features Neil Wiernik and Fortner Anderson, both of whom you'll see up here before long.

Because of the crowds, of course, you won't see a waiter with any regularity. And yeah so it's a wonderful crowd, it's nice to see everybody here, and let's just kind of segue into the evening.

So as first the widest applications of (poetry?) then the root, it feels I could take the opportunity to expound upon what I think happens here. Enough Said implies that the words that we've all been taking in perhaps aren't enough, that they require some delivery, some engaging accompaniment or just the expression involved, so they're accompanied with images. Now, that image is perhaps evocative at best, but like words, not the ideal vehicle or a good true representation. An image can represent a human being, inaccurately at best, and well, like a government can represent a people, inaccurately at best. Representations have been a problem it seems, so why can't we just present ourselves more often? I suppose that there perhaps aren't enough born anarchists and we're too fond of our image, anyways, the representation. We aren't looking at ourselves, we like looking at representations of ourselves. This is great, and a great problem simultaneously, I think. So it's really nice when here, I find a whole lot of wonderful words accompanied by often just as many thought-provoking and engaging images, and yet there's still space, although it may be hard to grasp the concept with the number of us all here in one room, but space between those images and those words nonetheless, and in that space I think there's room for that presentation, there's a community of sorts and that's what I'm finding most magical about Enough Said.
