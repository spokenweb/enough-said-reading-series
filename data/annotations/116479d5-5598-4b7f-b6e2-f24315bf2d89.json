Geez, you know, I can't, I can't say how happy I am to, you know, be a part of something that involves not only a generous helping of spectacle but, you know, a whole lotta love, and just generally rejuvenating experience. I think what I'd like to do is, like I said, take a little break. Any of the open-mikers who've hung out and are still up for it are more than welcome to have their day in the rain in a moment or two. I can't encourage people enough, as well, to come over to the corner at some point if you're going hang out for a bit. We've got loads of books, both Sharon's, bill's, and some small press offerings of various natures. You know, when I first bill, I was doing my degree at Concordia. I went down to the stacks in what was at that time the Norris Library. Do you know there are 41 titles of bill's in that library? Several of Sharon's as well. But 41---you're not going to find a lot of them in the bookstores anymore, but bill is part of a very, very vital scene, going back a good twenty odd years. [Sharon H. Nelson interacts (\"Pushing thirty!\")] Pushing thirty! And they're all still in the stacks, you know? You go down to what's now the Webster Library, or over to the Redpath, or any other incredible institution of those varieties, you can check the stuff out because I tell you, a whole lot of innovation went into the years between then and now. Okay, so---enjoy, hang out. | Video Description: Lee Gotham addresses audience while adjust microphone stand height. Gotham addresses audience and at one point addresses Sharon H. Nelson (off-screen) before returning his focus to the audience."
