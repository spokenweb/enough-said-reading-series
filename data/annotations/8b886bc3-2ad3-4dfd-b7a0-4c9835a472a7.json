In nearly spring, I have the immense pleasure this evening presenting two fine artists of various disciplinary persuasions. I would like to know that everyone is comfortable, as we have a real treat (?). We have, this evening, a cabaret of poetry. And the participants---and your performers---are Endre Farkas and Suzanne Nuttall. Endre Farkas started creating sound-text-movement poetry-performance pieces in the late 70s, before the spoken word was a glint in anyone's imagination. Endre worked with collaborators from different disciplines across Canada. He's also published seven books of poetry. His most recent book is Surviving Words (The Muses' Company, 1994) and is available along with the Bare Bones cassette (En Guard Records, 1994), pertaining to Suzanne Nuttall, who is one half of Bare Bones. They've just returned from a successful tour out West and in the Yukon. They've two cassettes and a CD to their credit. I think I see both CDs and cassettes, is that right (?), in your corner. Just on your way out, or on your way in, you can have a look at this stuff, because they're beautiful offerings. So, Bare's most recent CD-cassette is called Elusive and is available here this evening. So, both Surviving Words and Elusive---anytime, during the evening, you might wanna choose the intermission, but anytime, (on your left just before the?) door. And now, welcome to the cabaret!
