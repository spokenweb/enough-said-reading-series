I I'm actually, I'm zooming in from our AMPLab, Faith is right there too. So you can see this is the AMPLab at Concordia that Jason set up as one of the founders of SpokenWeb. We have a lot of new equipment here happening so it's a very cool space, and I I'm from Brazil originally but my family's from all over the place and ended up in Montreal with, in the creative writing program. Entered last year, and joined SpokenWeb, and I'm writing about border crossing poets and border crossing poetry that is interesting in borders between languages and cultures, but especially people caught in between those borders. Yeah. And definitely I talk about bureaucracy. I feel like all my poems are about bureaucracy in one way or another."

So the series has been a real real treat to see so many familiar faces, and also people who are completely new to me, and also seeing the origins of many, many performers as well, who I, who I really admire and have grown to admire. So, yeah, I feel very grateful to to your series as well, I think it's a real predecessor for a lot of cool stuff that was to come in Montreal.

So if if things aren't really coming to you today, that's okay, or if you feel like, you know, a real urge to go down a particular tangent like that's, that's the kind of thing we look for and we really like about doing oral history. It's, we're not coming here to kind of dig out very specific information rather than wanting to get a sense of what the time was like and what the scene was like, for you, and asking some guiding questions to be able to make some of those memories for you a bit clearer, or get out some of the things that you want to talk abou so we have guiding questions today, but there that's what really what they are just a guide, and we can move through when we come up with questions as as we go."

Regardless, I probably felt the same inclination musically, and I did in fact, get myself on stage in front of various audiences all through South-Central Ontario during my teens. But, I I gave up after having lost 3 or 4 bass players, and I began to feel as though maybe the the rock and roll path was going to be something of the self-indulgence. So I turned to writing as my only vocal coach did suggest that \"Wow! These these songs you're coming up with are really great, Maybe that should be your focus. The songwriting versus the vocalizations.\" So I realized at that point that \"Hey, I'm free to\" I had a troubled secondary education and was at my sort of seventeenth year, \"free to to move on in any direction I wanted to,\" so I chose to start writing and take take it on the road."

So, I started a BA in English. it was, you know, a augmented program. I guess I had to, oh, I can't remember 18 additional credits to accomplish something like that a half a year's work. Yeah, so regardless I I did I did, you know, remarkably well, considering I hadn't prePared myself much. And yeah, at the end of it I had a Honors B.A. in English and and, went back to my old traveling ways, and after another 2 years had been encouraged to try out the the graduate writing program, and it was accepted into the masters. and did that as well. So that was all just in the lead up and around the same time, as Enough Said."

And and and and you mentioned also your brother with the world traditions, trying to to to, to to jazz between traditions as well. And I feel like I see that in the way you curated the series again getting ahead of ourselves, but I don't want to also put words in your mouth. But I like a feeling this is a feeling that that to me is very clear. and and I feel like you're giving them back history to something that I really felt watching some of those videos. I just wanted to make that commentary that's not really a question."

But also, like, you know, this kind of comfort and self assurance with like, what a scene is essentially, and I know I'm speaking incredibly, vaguely, but also like just the the concept of being in an artistic community, you seem extremely comfortable with and curating in these videos, and I'm wondering you know about, if you want to talk a little bit about you know, playing in your first bands, touring a little bit, like you've mentioned, and starting to get to know what an artistic community is like.

Basically an Olympics style event which involved, instead of rigorous athletic discipline, just a lot of of hilarity and and and well-intended partying, basically.

But I went up to the edge of Langtang when you could see the border with Tibet but I couldn't cross, and of course Langtang was the region that was very, very affected by the 2005 earthquake, was the epicenter. Langtang village was raised it was very sad, and I was there like 2 weeks before it happened, so like, give me the goosebumps talking about Langtang."

I had a landscaping job that that I'd go to and whatnot, but I really I felt as though I were standing in one place for 6 months, watching people zoom past in various directions with their with their crazy, busy lives. India, I suppose, you know, did that to me, but I think perhaps I had just, you know, arrived at that point somewhat naturally. I needed to soak in what was going on around me and do a lot less emoting, a a lot less expressing. So I I didn't you know hole hole up in a in a room, and not go anywhere, but I did have that sensation of being very much outside of the the mainstream, which I kind of always was outside the mainstream, but outside of all the streams. I was just very remote from from what was going on in south central Ontario, and Canada in general maybe at that moment."

I just felt those were just a little too far outside of the literary tradition to to qualify. So, although I I wanted to use music as much as any other staging and costuming and dramatic types of of manifestations that the that the text could could take I didn't want it to devolve into, you know, a a a whatever, a a a folky, you know, strum along type of thing, or a or a you know a stand up, you know, comic type of experience. So those were the 2 extremes I decided to exclude, but I, outside of that I really wanted to be as inclusive as I could, and I was, I think I think that's basically what was at the heart of Enough Said. Had it been just another reading series, I don't think we would be talking to each other just now."

But because you often will see some of these people, even like weekly at these open mics, and identifying some of those faces will be really great. But there were a few people, though, that we do know that we were interested, especially in the local scene. We're hearing more about. For example, I think one of the recurring presences throughout the series is the Fluffy Pagan Echoes, for example. Yeah, Justin McGrail, Victoria Stanton, Vincent Tinguely, oh, I'm forgetting the 2 other guys, [Lee Gotham offers names] Scott Duncan, yep. and another fellow, who, Ran, yes."

But it's not super common anymore, necessarily, to have like a kind of more formalized spoken word collective. And it's been really great to see a kind of work like through the series.

I mean, it was so rootsy it was ridiculous you could smell it in the air when you walked up the stairs before he even opened the door. The place, and I'm not talking about pot, I'm talking about, it's genuine you know, grassroots. They were they were freedom fighters the guys that ran that place, I didn't know any of them personally that all of the echoes would have known the much better than I did.

We immediately had a long, you know, conversation that had nothing to do with Enough Said. Just got ourselves caught up together.
